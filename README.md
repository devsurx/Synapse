# 🧬 Synapse: Your Neural Garden (v0.4)

Forget cold, mechanical timers. **Synapse** is a living workspace designed to help you breathe, focus, and grow. It turns the friction of deep work into a biological ritual—where every minute of focus nourishes a digital ecosystem that evolves alongside your own mind.

## 🪴 What’s New in the Garden?

v0.4 is the **Atmospheric Update**, designed to pull you out of a busy room and into a calm, private sanctuary.

### 🌧️ The Rain Sanctuary
The centerpiece of this update is a fully immersive weather engine. We didn't just add "noise"—we built a sensory storm designed to induce a flow state.
- **Organic Downpour:** Most apps use a flat overlay. Synapse features a 3D-layered rain system with depth. Some drops fall fast and close, others are distant and misty, creating the sensation of looking through a window into a forest.
- **Natural Physics:** The raindrops feature a slight "wind-slant" and randomized timing, ensuring the visual never feels repetitive or robotic.
- **Audio Immersion:** A lush, high-fidelity looping rain soundscape (`rain.mp3`) that drowns out environmental distractions.
- **Smart Weather:** The rain is tied to your biology—it clears the moment your focus session ends, signaling a mental "reset" and bringing the sunlight back for your break.

## 🎖️ The Rank Hierarchy
Progression in Synapse is visual and prestigious. As you complete missions, your rank title and the primary UI accents change color to reflect your dedication.

| Level | Rank Title | UI Color Theme | Aesthetic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lvl 1-4** | **NEURAL SPROUT** | 🌱 Sprout Green | The beginning of growth. Faint, soft glow. |
| **Lvl 5-9** | **SYNERGIC STEM** | 🧊 Focus Blue | Strengthening connections. Clearer, sharper aura. |
| **Lvl 10-19** | **COGNITIVE CANOPY** | 🟣 Neural Purple | Deep mastery. Intense, vibrant energy. |
| **Lvl 20+** | **THE ETERNAL OAK** | 👑 Eternal Gold | Peak performance. A legendary, golden shimmer. |

### ⚔️ Compete with Friends
Who has the strongest focus? While Synapse is a private sanctuary, you can turn your growth into a competition:
* **Screenshot Battles:** Share your **Neural History** grid. A sea of green dots is the ultimate proof of discipline.
* **Level Racing:** Compare your **Garden Lvl** in the header. The higher the level, the more hours of deep work you’ve clocked.
* **The Wilt Challenge:** See who can go the longest without triggering the **Withered (🥀)** state. Once you hit *The Eternal Oak*, you’ve reached the top—see who can get there first!

## 🧠 The Cognitive Toolkit

Synapse isn't just a timer; it's a laboratory for your mind. Beyond the garden, you’ll find five specialized modules designed to turn "studying" into "mastering":

* **Feynman Tab:** Inspired by the legendary physicist Richard Feynman. This module is based on the idea that *if you can’t explain it simply, you don't understand it.* Use this space to write out concepts as if you were teaching them to a class. It forces you to find the gaps in your knowledge.
* **ELI5 Tab (Explain Like I'm Five):** The ultimate test of clarity. Strip away the jargon and the complex "filler" words. This module helps you boil down massive ideas into their most basic, undeniable truths.
* **Flashcard Tab:** Combat the "Forgetting Curve." Use this for active recall—the most scientifically proven way to move information from short-term memory into long-term storage.
* **Chat Tab:** Your Neural Co-pilot. Whether you need to brainstorm a project, query a difficult fact, or just reflect on what you've learned today, the Chat tab is your space for real-time intellectual dialogue.
* **Planner Tab:** Intention is the seed of focus. Use the Planner to map out your day, set your primary objectives, and decide exactly what you are going to nourish in your garden today.

## ✨ Why it Feels Different

### 🌬️ A Breathing Ecosystem
The garden doesn't just sit there; it breathes. The **Aura** behind your plant pulses with a steady, calming rhythm, encouraging you to match your own breathing to the timer. Tiny **Pollen Orbitals** drift around the core like fireflies, giving the app a kinetic, "alive" energy.

### 🥀 Real Stakes (The Wither Mechanic)
Focus is a commitment. If you abandon a mission halfway through, your garden will **Wilt**. It’s a gentle, visual reminder that your consistency matters. But don't worry—a new session always brings the green back.

### 📊 Your Neural Story
Check your **Neural History** to see a 14-day map of your progress. It’s a minimalist dot-matrix that visualizes your "Wins" and "Losses," making it easy to see your focus streaks at a glance.
